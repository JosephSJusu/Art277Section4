 <h1>Travelling in Depression</h1>
   
When I was very little, I caught the travel bug. It started after my grandparents first brought 
me to their home in France and I have now been to twenty-nine different countries. Each has 
given me a unique learning experience.<br><br>
 
At five, I marveled at the Eiffel Tower in the City of Lights. When I was eight, I stood in the 
heart of Piazza San Marco feeding hordes of pigeons, then glided down Venetian waterways 
on sleek gondolas.

At thirteen, I saw the ancient, megalithic structure of Stonehenge and
walked along the Great Wall of China, amazed that the 
thousand-year-old stones were still in place.
 <br><br>
It was through exploring cultures around the world that I first became interested in language.
  <br><br>
It began with French, which taught me the importance of 
pronunciation. I remember once asking a store owner in Paris 
where Rue des Pyramides was. But when I pronounced it 
PYR–a–mides instead of pyr–A–mides, with more accent on 
the A, she looked at me bewildered.
 <br><br>
In the eighth grade, I became fascinated with Spanish and 
aware of its similarities with English through cognates. 
Baseball in Spanish, for example, is béisbol, which looks 
different but sounds nearly the same. This was incredible to 
me as it made speech and comprehension more fluid, and even today I find that cognates 
come to the rescue when I forget how to say something in Spanish.
<br><br>
Then, in high school, I developed an enthusiasm for Chinese. As I studied Chinese at my 
school, I marveled how if just one stroke was missing from a character, the meaning is lost. I 
loved how long words were formed by combining simpler characters, so Huǒ (火) meanin
loved how long words were formed by combining simpler characters, so Huǒ (火) meaning 
fire and Shān (山) meaning mountain can be joined to create Huǒshān (火山), which means 
volcano. I love spending hours at a time practicing the characters and I can feel the beauty 
and rhythm as I form them.
