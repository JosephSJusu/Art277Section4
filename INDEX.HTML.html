     <p>
  We've heard it all since the pandemic started-lemon juice can kill the coronavirus, masks
  don't work, if you already had  <a href="GROUP.html">COVID-19</a> you can't get it again or
  the vaccine approved for

   emergency use will change your DNA or put a tracking device in your body.

   <p>It's almost like we need a strong dose of something to knock out all of the misinformation. But
  despite all the myths and urban legends, about half of the U.S. population is fully vaccinated.<br>

  wonderful news, right? wonderful news, right?<br>
  
  well, not to some. vaccinated people are up against a
  new set of myths-they're literally magnetic or
  they're going to shed vaccine components and alter
  the DNA of unvaccineted people. And despite the extra
  layer of protection, they still have to grapple with the 
  same pandemic realities as everyone else.</p>

  <br>

  <p>

   so, what do vaccinated people need to do to stay safe? And is still possible for them to spread
  COVID-19 to other? infectious disease specialist <a href="">Lyssette Cardona</a>, MD, answer those
  questions and covers why vaccination is still one of our best weapon in the fight against
  COVID-19.
